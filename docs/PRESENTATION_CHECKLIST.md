5. 10x productivity is achievable

## Common Questions - Prepared Answers

**Q: What about GraphQL?**
A: Different tools, same principles apply.

**Q: How do you handle breaking changes?**
A: OpenAPI versioning + compiler catches issues.

**Q: What if AI generates bugs?**
A: Always review and test. AI is a starting point.

**Q: Can this work with existing projects?**
A: Yes! Generate spec from existing code first.

**Q: What about authentication?**
A: Define in OpenAPI, implement as middleware.

**Q: Learning curve?**
A: If you know Go and REST, productive in a day.

**Q: Production ready?**
A: Yes, used by real companies in production.

**Q: What about microservices?**
A: Perfect! Each service gets its own spec.
